        <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p><img src="img/frosted-cookie.jpg" class="imgfloatright" alt="Photo of Pat's Salmon Cookie" /> Pat's Salmon Cookies is a delicious new concept in nutritious and guilt-free baked goods. Combining the health benefits of Northwest-sourced salmon with a family cookie recipe handed down for generations, Pat's Salmon Cookies are a delight for any fan of scrumptious baked goods.</p>
        <h2>A Healthy Treat for Everyone</h2>
          <p>We use only wild caught Northwest salmon, locally grown and milled organic flour, organic Northwest honey harvested from the 98115 zip code, and organic rRbst-hormone free milk and butter produced and churned by dairy farms in Pierce County that use sustainable farming practices.</p>
          <p><img src="img/family.jpg" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Photo of family enjoying cookies and milk" />Stop by one of our stores and pick up some Pat's Salmon Cookies for your next event! Offered individually or save with an entire dozen (and of course we always provide a "baker's dozen"!) Our Pat's Salmon Cookies freeze well and can be stored without compromizing their unique flavor and texture for up to 1 year! Be sure to stock up today! Great for barbecues, potlucks, bake sales, tailgating parties, and <b>especially to bring the whole family together for a treat you can feel good about!</b></p>
